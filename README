python code used to solve the kaggle connectenomix code challenge.

challenge is to map a neuron network based on flourescence imaging.  essentially this is a time series correlation
exercise with some twists.  most people approached it from a "transfer entropy" mathematical direction.  i tried
that approach but also attacked it from a straight graph analysis.

data pipeline is as follows:
1) munge
2) graph
3) analyze
